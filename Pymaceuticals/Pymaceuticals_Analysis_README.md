# Analysis of clinical trial results for four treatments: Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo

## Summary
Clinical trials of several drugs were performed using mice over a 45 day period.
Based upon the trial data, **Capomulin** appears to provide the most favorable overall results:
* Average Tumor Volume reduced by 19.5% with Capumulin, and it was the *only* drug treatment that reduced average Tumor Volume -- See *Figure 1: Total Volume Change Over 45-Day Treatment*
* Relatively consistent decrease in tumor volume throughout the trial period - See *Figure 2: Tumor Repsonse to Treatment*
* Lowest metastatic spread, with the number of metastatic sites averaging about 1.5 after 45 days of treatment - See *Figure 3: Metastatic Spread During Treatment*
* Highest rate of survival, with a survival rate of 84% at the end of the trial - See *Figure 4: Survival During Treatment*

## Other Observations
* Both Infubinol and Ketapril resulted in *increased* average Tumor Volume and relatively higher Metastatic Spread by the end of the trial, with Ketapril results being worse than Placebo - See *Figure 1*, *Figure 2*, *Figure 3*
* The Survival Rate for Infubinol was worse than for Placebo - See *Figure 4*
