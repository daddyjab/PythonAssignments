    "* 500 cities selected at random latitudes and longitudes from the entire range of lat./long. values could still result in a less than representative sample of cities in the world.\n",
    "* To mitigate this, a uniform grid of latitude and longitude points will be defined.  Then a set of random latitude and longitude points will be selected about each of these points, ensuring that our sample of cities will encompass all lat/long areas.\n",
    "* Citypy will then be used to identify cities near each of the sample points that have a population of over 500.\n",
    "* Granularity of the uniform lat/long grid will be adjusted so that approx 500 cities are selected in the random sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "1. Set the granularity (grid_gran) of the uniform latitude / longitude grid; start with grid_gran=10 degrees (which yields 648 grid areas)\n",
    "    * Number of latitude grid sections = (180 - [-180]) / grid_gran = 360 / grid_gran\n",
    "    * Number of longitude grid sections = (90 - [-90]) / grid_gran = 180 / grid_gran\n",

    "1. For each lat/long grid point, generate a small set of random sample of lat/long points from within the grid_gran by grid_gran area about the lat/long grid point.\n",
    "1. For each random sample lat/long point, use citipy to determine the nearest city. If the citipy nearest city is within the grid_gran by grid_gran area surrounding the sample lat/long point, then include it in our list of cities.  Otherwise exclude that city from list of cities -- it is not representative of the sample lat/long point.\n",
    "1. Manually check the tally of cities in the city list to see if we have about 500 cities.  If not, adjust the granularity (grid_gran) as appropriate.  (If we have way too many grid areas and resultant cities, then may need to just perform a random sample of the city list.)"
