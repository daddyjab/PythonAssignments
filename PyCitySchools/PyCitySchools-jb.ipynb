    "## Analysis of District-level Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "The PyCity School District serves over 39,000 students through the efforts of\n",
    "teachers and administrators at 15 District and Charter schools, with a total budget of $24.6 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The average district student exceeds minimum performance expectatations (passing: math and reading scores >= 70)\n",
    "* However, the % Passing Both Math and Reading (65.17%) metric suggests that on average almost 35% of district students fail to pass either Math or Reading, which should be a source of concern to the district.\n",
    "\n",
    "* While there is some range of performance on average student Reading scores on a per-school basis, the variation in math scores is more pronounced:\n",
    "    * Average Math Scores: 76.6 to 83.8 (7.2 percentage point difference) vs. Average Reading Scores: 80.7 to 84.0 (only 3.3 percentage point difference)\n",
    "    * % Passing Math: 65.7% to 94.6% (28.9 percentage point difference)\n",
    "    * % Passing Both Math and Reading: 53.0% to 91.3% (**38.3** percentage point difference!)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The metrics analyzed below indicate that student math scores vary more significantly with school size and school type, and show less variation with school spending and student grade level:\n",
    "    * % Passing Math is 70.0% at Large size schools vs. 93.6% at both Medium and Small size schools\n",
    "\n",
    "* As a next, analysis of additional school data may help determine if the variation with School Type is due to the relative size of Charter vs District schools, or if there are other factors involved:\n",
    "    * Charter schools (average = 1524 students) on average have less than half the number of students as District schools (average = 3854 students)\n"
